# Hi, I'm Martin! üëã


## üöÄ About Me
I am:
- A geek who loves Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and is getting into D&D
- Passionate about:
   - Automation
   - Cloud
   - Open source
   - Gaming
   - Tinkering 
   - Learning
   - Having fun with technology


## Some more info about me
### üë©‚Äçüíª I'm currently working on...

- A companion app for the board game [Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle Earth](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/the-lord-of-the-rings-journeys-in-middle-earth/), written in PowerShell (repo will be open-sourced once some initial code and logic is put together and organized)
    - Once the initial app is created, I would like to create a web-based version that folks can self-host and use to play the game remotely with friends and/or family
- A series of PowerShell scripts to help with Microsoft 365 and Azure management for other systems administrators that will benefit from my experiences with managing Microsoft's platform(s)
